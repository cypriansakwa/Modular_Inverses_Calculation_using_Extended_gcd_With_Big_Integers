This Rust program uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to compute the modular inverse of a huge number. 
It uses the num-bigint and num-traits crates to handle large integers and mathematical traits, respectively.

The program performs the following steps:
1. Computes the gcd(a,b) and the coefficients x and y such that gcd(a,b)=ax+by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
2. Determines the modular inverse if the gcd(a,b)=1.
